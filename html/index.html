  Jim's dream had always been to have his own radio station, where he could advertise his lemonade stand. He had already tried hijacking prexisting radio stations, but that never worked out well. After that, his friends told him about BroadcastR - he could finally create his own station! Now his lemonade stand gets a customer! Lucky Jim. You can get lucky too by joining! Do it! Now!
